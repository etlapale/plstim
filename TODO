[Painting]

- There seems to be border (stroke) around filled elements.

[Stimulus]

- Take luminance into account.

[OpenGL]

- We have some shift problems displaying on window (.5 issue?).

[Threading]

- Seems that the first frame after fullscreen got displayed too early.

[Code]

- Keep resizeGL() inside MyGLWidget, emit can_run_trial().

- Make enums available.
